/**
 * Opt-in synthetic demo cohort seeder (docs/plan1.md Task 11, docs/plan2.md
 * Task 8, docs/plan3.md Tasks 2, 4, and 12).
 *
 * <p>The bean exists only when {@code medicore.demo.seed=true} (default off,
 * typically supplied through the {@code MEDICORE_DEMO_SEED} environment
 * variable). When enabled, startup inserts the coherent three-branch
 * synthetic operations cohort under one clearly synthetic organization
 * ({@code DEMO-ORG-001}): three unmistakably synthetic branches of varied
 * size ({@code DEMO-BR-001} default/main, {@code DEMO-BR-002} north,
 * {@code DEMO-BR-003} harbor), branch-owned departments and professionals,
 * dated half-open availability intervals, beds in every operational status
 * ({@code AVAILABLE}/{@code OCCUPIED}/{@code MAINTENANCE}/
 * {@code OUT_OF_SERVICE}), same-branch patients, appointments with the
 * Task 9 bounded duration inside availability, open admissions that
 * genuinely occupy a bed through a live {@code AdmissionBedAssignment} row,
 * discharged admissions with no bed, emergency visits, and simulated
 * invoices — every reference same-branch and valid. All values are
 * fabricated demo data on the {@code synthetic.test} demo domain; no real
 * personal, clinical, or financial data ever enters this class.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every insert is lookup-before-create against a stable business key —
 * the organization code, the (organization, code) branch pair, the
 * (branch, code) department pair, the bed (branch, ward, room, bedNumber)
 * identity, the patient medical record number, the staff employee code, the
 * appointment composite key (patient + professional + scheduledAt + type),
 * the availability composite key (branch + professional + startsAt + endsAt),
 * an admission composite key (patient + admittedAt + reason), an emergency
 * composite key (patient + arrivalAt + complaint), and the unique invoice
 * number — so repeated startups insert zero records and add zero audit
 * events. The bed-assignment action is idempotent through the live
 * {@code (admission)} assignment row, so a run interrupted between the
 * admission insert and the bed assignment self-heals on the next startup
 * instead of leaving a contradiction. The seeder contains no delete,
 * update, or reset operation: existing rows are never touched, and unknown
 * pre-existing unassigned rows are never mass-updated. It creates no user
 * accounts and no credentials; passwords and secrets never appear here or
 * in the demo data (the admin and review accounts remain owned by
 * {@code DevAdminInitializer} and the runtime environment).</p>
 *
 * <p>Care-operation rows follow the Task 7A/8 persistence representation:
 * app-owned UUID branch references and String-typed canonical UUID patient
 * references. Their fixture keys use fresh 2031-era timestamps and the
 * {@code DEMO-INV-01xx/02xx/03xx} invoice numbers so a store that still
 * holds the pre-Task-12 Task 8 cohort can never shadow the branch-owned
 * rows: those older rows keep their null ownership, stay invisible through
 * every branch-scoped read exactly like any legacy row, and are never
 * adopted, renumbered, or reassigned (the entities expose no ownership
 * mutation, and reassigning unknown or historical rows stays forbidden).</p>
 *
 * <p>Rows are written directly through the repositories; every <em>newly
 * created</em> row is recorded through {@link AuditService} using the same
 * action/resource-type/detail conventions the owning services use
 * ({@code CREATE} for inserts; the admission bed-assignment action as
 * {@code UPDATE Admission} with the {@code bed: <id>} detail, matching
 * {@code AdmissionService}). The events are context-aware system events:
 * because no acting assignment exists during startup, the seeder records
 * each event under a system principal whose {@link ActingContext} carries
 * exactly the owning branch id of the resource the event describes — never
 * a fabricated assignment, role, scope, organization, or department (those
 * columns stay null, so no dangling ownership is invented and the rows
 * surface through the branch-scoped audit slices while remaining honestly
 * marked {@code legacy/unassigned} to organization-scoped ADMIN). The
 * organization's own event keeps the fully context-less shape, and the
 * security context is cleared immediately after every recording. Startup
 * events carry no correlation id (no request boundary exists). Reused
 * records record nothing — the absence of events for existing rows is
 * exactly what keeps repeated startups idempotent in the audit trail too.</p>
